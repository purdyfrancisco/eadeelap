So I came up with this thing. Tell me what do you think about it (hey, it wasn't intended to be meta relevant). (Just noticed this card is more about the 4 "main" characters of the story (Imduk, Ib, Avram, Ningirsu) than the World Legacies. I personnaly like how those "heroes" evolved, that's why I made this "fan card".) Made with Yugioh Card Maker. Yugioh card maker link. Новый сайт: new Sex-Tv.Lark.Ru.

Me and my friend want to have some fun playing using some cards we made using yugioh card maker. I was wondering if there was a program to use those cards. It seems even though the Custom card scene of this subreddit is boomin many people don't know where they can duel with custom cards, since DN is dedicated to the official game only and scripting 1000s of cards on YGOPro and setting a custom YGOPro server for custom cards can be a pain in the ass. So here I am going to teach you how to use Duel Portal(duelportal.us) to play using your own custom card (or of other people) without any scripting knowledge and an own server like you would Hay guys! When I was young, I was really into yugioh, I was 9-10 and I spent a great portion of my time watching the anime in shitty 4 part youtube video's, and reading parts of the manga on old manga sites. I collected cards, and spent WAY to much time on Yugioh Card Maker. However, at some point. I stopped. Recently, I got a new phone, and while looking at the app store, I noticed a game. A Yugioh game, where I could pretty much play the game for free, whitch is honestly pretty fantastic. EDIT: Due to a mod request, I decided to put in a spoiler warning. The archetype doesn't spoil anything too big, but if you're considering watching the show, I suggest you do it right now. Close this tab and go pull up Episode 1 right now. I was playing around with the Yugioh Card Maker, and decided to make an archetype based off of one of my favorite animes, Neon Genesis Evangelion. For those who haven't heard of it, the show is about teenagers piloting giant humanoid cyborgs to save humanity. I remember seeing somewhere there was an offline version of the Yugioh card maker website. Does anyone know where I could find it or something with similar capabilities. Greetings, had an idea for a card to deal with first turn lockdown fields/cards, such as 'Dimensional Barrier', 'Artifact Scythe' as well as lockdown cards like 'Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon', 'Cyber Dragon Infinity' or 'Toadally Awesome/Treatoad'. Any feedback on wording, conflicts with the games ruels, as well as balance would be appreciated. The card would be this: 'Breakthrough Burst' Trap, Counter; 'You can only activate this card during your turn. If your opponent controls a monster. I came back from locals and there's this one dude there who sometimes feels like talking to other humans. He plays Magic more than anything, but also somewhat focuses on Yugioh and My Little Pony. Yeah, you can smell where this is going. It's like that  Anyway, he mentioned that Burning Abyss was a shit deck and no one should play it. Maybe he was beaten by one lately, I dunno. He showed me some Magic cards, like 6 or so altogether. He says "think Yugioh is expensive? These are  together. Yugioh Card Maker is a forums site and not a subreddit for custom yugioh cards and you can see a lot more sorted into categories. Duel Portal is a website (duelportal.us) that works with the silverlight browser plugin(doesn't work on chrome) and it allows users to duel with custom cards. 
well hello, fellow yugioh card makers! hope you all enjoy trying your hand or even just reading the submissions! also hope some of you like the idea and try one yourselves. so, here we go: there is one rule you should know though; the archetype has to have an Lv monster. no extra deck cards or spells are required, but they may help you score more points. the winner will be announced either when I stop receiving ideas for 3 days, or in 2 weeks. --------------------------- Guess the winner. Hi! Recently, I've been delving deeper and deeper in the creative Yugioh scene. Players invent their own cards, review and balance them, then test their decks against each other. However, my hobby has started to reach its limits: -The popular create-a-card forums are pretty dead, and even the Yugioh Card Maker forum is pretty inactive, populated either by old-timers spending time exclusively in the Forum games/General discussion threads patting each other on the back, and new arrivals So here I am going to teach you how to use Duel Portal to play using your own custom card (or of other people) without any scripting knowledge and an own server like you would need with a YGOPro variant, also, with Duel Portal you don't need to download it. The only thing you need is a E-mail account. (P.S. it does not work on chrome, but it does with all other browsers) ## Logging in and registering Just like DN (or mostly any site really). I go on Yugioh Card Maker a lot and make archetypes and cards. I have made the Hunter archetype (Based around activating trap cards and using Hunter counters) and I am currently making the Damned archetype (Based around sending specific cards from your deck to the grave so they can be easily summoned and/or added to your hand). I would like to know if any of you have made any archetypes or cards. Post below if you have and what they do. Thank you for any responses because I am very curious This story takes place in the early 2000. I was in highschool at the time and I attended a private school. I took band because I had taken band in middle school and it was easy for me. My private school was kind of small. 300 students in High school and about 150 students in Middle School. There was also an elementary school in another building on the other side of the property. But we never saw them. They kept the Middle school and High schoolers together but distanced us from the younger. This deck is the deck i referred to in This Post (https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/ax0hls/after_a_long_hiatus_i_played_a_local_and_heres/) Note, I'm new to this sort of thing Monsters (21) 3x Beat, Bladesman Fur Hire(Starter) 3x Bravo, Fighter Fur Hire(Starter) 3x Donpa, Marksmen Fur Hire(Starter) 2x Dyna, Hero Fur Hire(Boss) 3x Helmer, Helmsman Fur Hire(Starter) 2x Rafale, Champion Fur hire(Boss) 3x Recon, Scout Fur hire(Starter) 1x Sagitta, Maverick Fur Hire(Boss). I am 22. I don’t know how to not lie anymore, and I just want to tell the truth somewhere. I am not gonna hurt anyone. I just feel alone and in a very dark place. Im writing this because I don’t know who to tell all this too. I’m gonna explain events. That I believe morphed me into this hideous person that I am. I was raised by my mom and I love her so dearly. My dad left me when I was 1, and didn’t see him again for five years. At the age of six I met him, and we talked. I don’t remember exact. I can honestly say I love it. It is one of my favourite manga series of all time with classics like Death Note, Bleach, Naruto, Black Cat, etc. I really wish more people read it because I think it s a lot better than the anime. If you had not read the manga, do so. You can view all manga on the Shonen Jump site where you all probably paid for the promos Reasons why: Duels: They are simple, easy to understand, suspenseful. I found the later manga really tries to add to many effec. 
I'm not sure if it's appropriate to post this kind of thing here, but Card Maker Forum wasn't helping too much and I thought I could use the knowledge of this sub. I love Ace Attorney and for a while I've been toying with what they would look like as a Yugioh deck. Thanks to Dueling Book I'm finally starting to bring it to life. I've been testing and editing it over several duels and have had a lot of fun with it. I wanted to ask if there's anything I can improve Forum Stats Last Post Info; Casual Card Design.
